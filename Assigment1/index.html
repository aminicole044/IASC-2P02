    <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

    <p> In this story, we see the expanding life beyond what we know, as Nick Sousanis has described flatness as the inability to see beyond what is presented in front of you.
        Long ago, there lived a blob. This blob lived in the sea. It would only see the creatures of the sea. They would swim freely without any worries and watch the other creatures explore this underwater world. The underwater world was a calming place. The creatures would roam around the colourful coral reef, the bottom was rough rock and sand. The bubbles that would form when the creatures breathe. The underwater world was all they ever knew. One day, the blob saw a shadow from up above. The shadow was different. It looked like a bigger version of a starfish, but not quite. It moved around with only the bottom half of the shape. The shadow didn't swim as fast as the other sea creatures. The shadow wasn't going underwater either. The shadow was there until it suddenly disappeared. The blob was confused, as it's something it's never seen before. The next day, the same shadow appeared with more shadows. Their sizes and shapes were different from each other, but similar. They were there sometimes, and sometimes would disappear only to return again. But why? The blob didn't understand the purpose of these shadows. They have never been there before, so why did they start appearing all of a sudden? The blob thought the shadows were bigger and more evolved versions of starfish.

        <p>The blob has a similar understanding to these shadows just as the people in the cave. All they see is what is presented in front of them. They fail to think that there is a world beyond their senses. Both scenarios relate to their flatness of thinking. They have never seen anything beyond the cave/sea. The shadows from the cave are controlled by others, so that the people in the cave believe in something. The people who live in the sea/cave don't know that these shadows are controlled or caused by something else; they just see what is in front of their eyes. The shadows in the sea only see from down below. This unknown knowledge is new to the blob.

<h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>


<p>The shadows aren't what they appear to be. The shadows are actually people. When the weather gets hot, the people decide to visit the beach and watery areas to cool off. The beach has sand, rocks, water, ice cream stands, exactly what people need to cool off. Outside of the ocean, the people see the other things that are on the surface such as sand and the roads. People come in all shapes and sizes, changing their shadow appearance. The sun is above, so when the people are underneath it, it causes them to cast shadows. The outside world has many different colours, which forms the beautiful sceneries that people experience. These shadows appear to be above from the blob’s point of view, as the ocean is even lower. They see the sun, the fact that its a light source. The people can see and acknowledge that there is something beneath them in the water. All the people see is that it expands into the beyond, the beyond that they don't know. The people cannot see what is down below. They don't know or understand that there are creatures beneath them. </p>

<p>
    Nick Sousanis would define ‘seeing double’ as expanding our thinking. When we learn to expand our thinking, beyond the ‘flatness’ beyond our senses, the world can have even more things in store for us. Just because something appears a certain way, it doesn't mean it to be true. The people in the cave thought the shadows were merely shadows, even though they were other people from outside of the cave. The people outside the cave didn't know that their shadows were being watched. Similarly the blob thought the shadows were an evolved version of starfish, not even considering that there are creatures beyond the sea. The people who were creating those shadows didn't know that there were creatures that didn't know what they were. These two stories can be compared to thinking in 2D, thinking ‘flat’. Each perspective sees the other as something else. Each one isn't aware about the expanding world that they live in, with the multiple creatures that exist, or even creatures that might exist. </p>
